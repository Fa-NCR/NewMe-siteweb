						<h2>What are Interpersonal Skills?</h2>
						<p>Interpersonal skills are sometimes referred to as social skills, people skills, soft skills, or life skills.</p>
						<p>However, these terms can be used both more narrowly and more broadly than ‘interpersonal skills’.</p>
						<p>On this website, we define interpersonal skills as:“The skills you need and use to communicate and interact with other people.”
							This definition means that interpersonal skills therefore include: 
							communication skills which in turn covers verbal and non verbal communication and listening skills, emotional intelligence, team working, 
							negotiation, persuasion, influencing skills, conflict resolution and mediation, problem solving and decision-making...</p>

									<p>In the course of our lives, we have to communicate with and interact with other people on a daily if not hourly basis, and sometimes more often. 
										Good interpersonal skills ‘oil the wheels’ of these interactions, making them smoother and pleasanter for all those involved. 
										They allow us to build better and longer-lasting relationships, both at home and at work.</p>

								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>Good interpersonal skills help you to communicate more effectively with family and friends.</p>
									<p>This is likely to be particularly important with your partner. 
										For example, being able to give and receive feedback effectively with your partner can help to resolve small problems between you before they become big issues.</p>
									<p>There is more about this, and other aspects of using interpersonal skills at home, in our pages on Personal and Romantic Relationship Skills and Parenting Skills.</p>

									<p>You may not like to think about it in these terms, but you almost certainly spend more time with your colleagues than your partner.</p>
									<p>At work, you are required to communicate with and interact with a wide range of people, from suppliers and customers through to your immediate colleagues, colleagues further afield, your team and your manager.
										 Your ability to do so effectively can make the difference between a successful working life, and one spent wondering what went wrong.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>You may already have a good idea of areas that you need to develop.
										 However, it is worth seeking feedback from other people, because it is easy to develop ‘blind spots’ about yourself. 
										You might also find it useful to do our Interpersonal Skills Self-Assessment.</p>
									<p>The self-assessment may give you an idea of which areas to develop first. 
										It may, however, also be worth starting with the basics, and moving on from there.</p>

									<h3 class="timeline-title">2.Focus on your basic communication skills</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>Some would even go so far as to suggest that there is a reason why you have two ears and one mouth, and that you should therefore listen twice as much as you talk!</p>
								<p>Listening is very definitely not the same as hearing. 
									Perhaps one of the most important things you can do for anyone else is to take the time to listen carefully to what they are saying, considering both their verbal and non-verbal communication. 
									Using techniques like questioning and reflection demonstrates that you are both listening and interested.</p>
								<p>When you are talking, be aware of the words you use. 
										Could you be misunderstood or confuse the issue? Practise clarity and learn to seek feedback or clarification to ensure your message has been understood. 
										By using questions effectively, you can both check others’ understanding, and also learn more from them.</p>
								<p>You may think that selecting your words is the most important part of getting a message across, but non-verbal communication actually plays a much bigger part than many of us are aware. 
									Some experts suggest that around three-quarters of the ‘message’ is communicated by non-verbal signals such as body language, tone of voice, and the speed at which you speak</p>

								</div>
								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>Communication is rarely perfect and can fail for a number of reasons. 
										Understanding more about the possible barriers to good communication means that you can be aware of—and reduce the likelihood of—ineffective interpersonal communication and misunderstandings. 
										Problems with communication can arise for a number of reasons, such as:</p>
									<p><em>Physical barriers</em>, for example, being unable to see or hear the speaker properly, or language difficulties;</p>
									<p><em>Emotional barriers</em>, such as not wanting to hear what is being said, or engage with that topic; and</p>
									<p><em>Expectations and prejudices</em> that affect what people see and hear.</p>

									<h3 class="timeline-title">4.Look inwards</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>Interpersonal skills may be about how you relate to others, but they start with you. 
										Many will be improved dramatically if you work on your personal skills.
										For example, people are much more likely to be drawn to you if you can maintain a positive attitude. 
										A positive attitude also translates into improved self-confidence.</p>			
									<p>You are also less likely to be able to communicate effectively if you are very stressed about something.
										 It is therefore important to learn to recognise, manage and reduce stress in yourself and others (and see our section on Stress and Stress Management for more).
										  Being able to remain assertive, without becoming either passive or aggressive, is also key to effective communication. 
										  There is more about this in our pages on Assertiveness.Perhaps the most important overarching personal skill is developing emotional intelligence.</p>

								</div>
								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>There are a number of situations in which you need to use interpersonal skills.
										 Consciously putting yourself in those positions, and practising your skills, then reflecting on the outcomes, will help you to improve.
										For example:</p>
									<p>-Interpersonal skills are essential when working in groups.</p>
									<p>-Interpersonal skills may also be particularly helpful if you have to negotiate, persuade and influence others.</p>
									<p>-Resolving and mediating in conflict scenarios can be a real test of interpersonal skills.</p>
									<p>-Finally, problem-solving and decision-making are usually better when they involve more than one person.</p>

									<h3 class="timeline-title">6.Reflect on your experience and improve</h3>
								</div>
								<div class="timeline-body">
									<p>The final element in developing and improving your interpersonal skills is to develop the habit of self-reflection. 
										Taking time to think about conversations and interpersonal interactions will enable you to learn from your mistakes and successes, and continue to develop. 
										You might, for example, find it helpful to keep a diary or learning journal and write in it each week.</p>
